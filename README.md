# A cell atlas foundation model retraining
SCimilarity is a unifying representation of single cell expression profiles that quantifies similarity between expression states and generalizes to represent new studies without additional training.

This enables a novel cell search capability, which sifts through millions of profiles to find cells similar to a query cell state and allows researchers to quickly and systematically leverage massive public scRNA-seq atlases to learn about a cell state of interest.
